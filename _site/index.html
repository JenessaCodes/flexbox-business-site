      <h2>About The Company</h2>
      <p>Assent Dance Company was formed to bolster the community of dance through the learning, sharing, and practice of consent culture. 
        It is owners', instructors' and community members' intention is to interfuse the fun or learning dance and its cultural roots with 
        developing emotional awareness and social ettiquete within our dance community. We provide tools, trainings, 
        and employ a holistic approach towards becoming integrated into the complex and beautiful lifestyle of dancing with people 
        and taking care of the plethora of nuances it brings to us. Rather than feeling alone and experiencing culture shock, 
        we hope to provide a comfortable transition into our communtity.

          <p>Hello, my name is Jenessa. I wholeheartedly support the practice of verbal consent language. 
            I keep a running list of phrases that communicate consent tactfully and clearly 
            so that dancers can have an arsenal of helpful communication tools at their disposal and be able to enjoy 
            and feel confident using their voice. I have been dancing for 4 months and this is my first gig assistant teaching!</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Hello, I'm Marco. I have come a long-way learning the experiences of other dancers throughout my years. In my formative years, 
            I was instructed to follow certain ideals and dance according to a strict framework that imposed rigid boxes around both leads and followers. 
            I have since explored challenging traditionally held constructs of partner dancing and have rejected especially divisive and non-inclusive practices. 
            Now, I appreciate the beauty of both roles of dance and enjoy dance more because I am not limited by societal restrictions and desctructive values. 
            I teach by gathering insight from both perspectives-- as a lead and a follow!
